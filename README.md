##protein
There are four major class of macromolecules, which are carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. However, due to the toxicity and specificity, majority of successful drugs are developed in order to bind to target PROTEINS to modify their activities. Binding cavities of proteins are necessary for the function of protien as most of the drugs compete for the binding sites to exert their pharmacological activities. To aid drug discovery, protein are crystallized to reveal their 3-dimensional structures which are deposited to the RCSB Protien Data Bank. In that way, we can exploited them as a fishing nets(i.e., binding cavity, surface groove and allosteric site) in the design of new chemicals that will modulate their functions.
